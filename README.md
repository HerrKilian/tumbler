## What is this?

A simple physics simulation/meditation/relaxation tool.

Ultimately the main motivating factor for this experiment was my desire to learn a bunch of "new" technologies:

* [Box2dWeb](https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/) - Rather than roll my own physics I decided to finally take the plunge and learn how to use a real physics engine.
* SVG - Most of my prior experiments were built using Canvas or DOM rendering. Decided SVG would be interesting.
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - 99.9% of my coding at work is in JS. Decided this would be a good chance to trying something new.
* [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) - As a last minute decision, I decided it would be nice to play with something entirely new.
